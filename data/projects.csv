1,Instructional Design,"In this project, myself and my teammate researched  the factors driving competency-based grading in middle school and the need for a taxonomy to interpret state guidelines.",imgs/image1.jpg,"As I began my grad school in spring 2025, I joined hands with an educator from Kansas to formulate a research topic for a 600-level course project. The course was ""Advanced Learning Environments Design""  focused on instructional design and modes of curriculum delivery. It was a 2 member group project. The focus area for our project was standardizing curriculum definition & grading system for K-12 across the US. Schools across the US follow different curriculum structure and grading mechanisms set by education boards. This largely depends on the state and the school's district. Interpretation of academic standards and rubric vary vastly. We identified terminologies and real-world objects that are loosely interconnected in real-time and also in the digital system. 

We intially bounced ideas as shown in the image above. My teammate lamented, from her own experience, how it can be cumbersome to interpret state standards into a measurable outcome.","We utilized the Design Thinking for Educators Toolkit by IDEO, as a tool to ideate and reflect throughout the project cycle. The initial phase involved in specifiyng the problem. My teammate as an educator, contributed to detailing the problem statement. We set out to identify the current state of curriculum, particularly in middle school and high school, methods and metrics used by teachers. Also, most schools use Canvas LMS for curriculum management and assessment.","The problem statement is to identify a taxonomy for implementing Curriculum standards that is defined by different States in the US. Competencies can be defined based on a taxonomy. Defining a taxonomy will serve as a template for educators to define their curriculum and translate those standards into Canvas LMS. Also, the current Canvas LMS does not have the option to map to quiz questions to a Criteria. For this project, we focused on Iowa State Standards. The real-world objects were vastly different from the objects contained within the system. When the nomenclature is different across spaces, the object map and it's relationships become disconnected. That's the problem we set out to solve.

Refer to the list of definitions provided by Education Department of Iowa. ","Before elicitation process, we collected a list of terms and descriptions that are present in the real-world and in the system. In Canvas Learning Management System (LMS), an outcome refers to a measurable statement that defines what students should know or be able to do at the end of a learning experience. Outcomes are used to assess student learning and performance, aligning with specific educational standards or learning goals.","Given the project duration, the research was qualitative and exploratory in nature. My team identified educators, subject matter experts for user interviews. My teammate set to discover insights from her discussions with educators in her circle. I conducted unstructured converstions with an industry expert who specializes in Human Factors and is also an experienced eductor. We utilized IDEO's research prep template as a starter. The selection of interview location was also crucial, as human subjects are comfortable in their natual environment.arch text 1","We set forth by asking fundamental questions.
(1) What metrics are used in your institution to measure competencies of students?
(2) Who is the responsible for Curriculum definition and where do educators fit in this process?
(3) To what degree, is the system automated in your organization's delivery process?
(4) How is the real-world taxonomy of you delivery mechanism is translated into the LMS? ","We identified a recurring theme from the conversations. Instructors would like to spend less time in curriculum creation, defining course outcomes, rubrics. Only a few educators create their rubrics. Educators would love someone else to define the outcomes. Outcomes can be a separate entity and not a child entity of Courses in the LMS. Question-Criteria mapping is not supported by the system. Before developing user story maps, and prototypes, I identified a possible taxonomic workflow for interpreting broad education standards into an actionable outcome. The example provided in the image considers Number Systems for grade 8 mathematics. The real-world objects are identified into discrete units before being interpreted into the system.","After decomposition of tasks, I developed user roles, user activities, user stories for identified tasks. My teammate, as an educator, validated the decomposition. We also sought to verify the requirements with a curriculum coordinator in my teammate's institution. These can be seen as green stickies in the image below.",I created 8-step workflow which curriculum coordinators and instructors can use to create curriculum and course assignments. This is essentially a rubric that can be applied to any course or curriculum. The workflow depicts the steps in a real-world setting and the assimilation of those objects in the Learning Management System.,"The project was conceptual, hence we did not focus on the user interface or user experience in the system. Rather, we sought to identify the workflow, and capture those tasks in the system. I designed a high-fidelity workflow to depict the user-flow.","We gathered feedback on the workflow and the depth of automation. Feedback was provided by a school's curriculum coordinator and a usability expert. Curriculum coordinator liked the idea of weighted average for Outcomes as some criteria might be more meaninful than others. They particularly preferred the idea of the LMS recommending course outcomes rather than the instructor deciding. This reduces manual intervention and cognitive load. Each rubric is customized to assess specific outcomes, which helps instructors and students understand expectations and objectives

The usability expert provided feedback on the interface prototype, suggesting improvements such as making certain elements more obvious, appropriate labeling, and reducing the amount of white space.","The duration of the semester prevented us from testing the proposed workflow with a larger sample. The mapping of real word objects with the existing system objects is a real-time exercise, and we cannot be certain that curriculum designers will find the workflow any easier. The struggle lies in interpreting the state guidelines and manually creating the taxonomy for various subjects. This will be laborious and time-consuming. Metrics of the workflow also depends on the user experience in the system."
