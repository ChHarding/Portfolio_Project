About Me,"I'm Sanchay, a T-shaped designer. I design products and find myself at the intersection of <strong>user-centered design</strong>, <strong>engineering</strong>, and <strong>user research</strong>. My expertise lies in product management, user research, design, and development. With my experience designing super-structures and substructures in construction, I found my passion for visual and product design as a <strong>Business Analyst</strong>. I'm pursuing my master's degree in <strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong> at Iowa State University. Before starting my journey in HCI, I worked as a Business Analyst for <a href=""https://www.revature.com/"" class = ""special-link""  target = ""_blank"">Revature</a>, an EdTech firm based in Reston. I spearheaded agile product development,  requirements engineering, and stakeholder management. I was a product owner for an in-house assessment tool. Throughout my journey, I have gained wisdom and insight from many companions I have worked with.
<p>Before transitioning to product design,  I was a Rebar Designer for <a href=""https://groupeagf.com/"" class = ""special-link""  target = ""_blank"">AGF</a>, a Canadian construction giant with global operations. Whether designing structural elements or designing digital products, I recognize numerous parallels between my present work and the experiences I've gained in the past. Wherever I find myself on this journey, I am drawn to solving problems visually, offering radical yet straightforward solutions, triangulating user needs, and learning from my missteps. During the summer, I was motivated to learn graphic design principles (from  CalArts), composition rules, and meaning-making. This motivated me to take art classes this fall semester to supplement my artistic thinking. I enjoy pencil sketching, digital art, and doodling, whatever comes to mind. I also travel solo frequently and hope to explore hidden gems across the United States.",imgs/selfie.jpg
Flask and Jinja,"To showcase my work, I created this portfolio website in Python. This is also my first foray into coding. I created this website using Python's <a href=https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/ class = ""special-link""  target = ""_blank"">Flask</a> framework. Jinja web templating is used for the front end, with CSS and some JavaScript. For data structures, I used <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html class = ""special-link""  target = ""_blank"">Pandas</a> dataframe. This project was enjoyable to work on. I will enhance the website's fluidity and add more projects iteratively. The templating features offered by Flask are quite extensive. I created the model-view-controller architecture and deployed the code via <strong>Render</strong>, but Render spins down a free web service if there is no inbound traffic. Hence, I deployed the code via <strong>PythonAnywhere</strong>. <strong>OpenSeadragon</strong> API is used to handle image properties and functions. For code reference, check my GitHub.
