About Me,"I'm Sanchay, a T-shaped designer. I design products and find myself at the intersection of technology, user, and user experience. My expertise lies in product management, design, and development. With my experience designing super-structures and substructures in construction, I found my passion for visual and product design as a Business Analyst. I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in HCI at Iowa State University. Before starting my journey in HCI, I worked as a Business Analyst for <a href=""https://www.revature.com/"" class = ""special-link""  target = ""_blank"">Revature</a>, an EdTech firm based in Reston. I spearheaded agile product development,  requirements engineering, and stakeholder management. I was a product owner for an in-house assessment tool. Through my journey, I have gained wisdom and insight from the numerous companions who have worked with me.
<p>Before transitioning to product design,  I was a Rebar Designer for <a href=""https://groupeagf.com/"" class = ""special-link""  target = ""_blank"">AGF</a>, a Canadian construction giant with global operations. Whether drawing construction grid lines to align structural elements or creating grid lines to define digital hierarchy in product design, I see many parallels between my current work and the forms I created in my previous work. Wherever I find myself on this journey, I am drawn to solving problems visually, offering radical yet straightforward solutions, triangulating user needs, and learning from my missteps.
<p>During the summer, I was motivated to learn graphic design principles (from  CalArts), composition rules, and meaning-making. This motivated me to take art classes this fall semester to supplement my artistic thinking. I enjoy pencil sketching, digital art, and doodling, whatever comes to mind. I also travel solo frequently and hope to explore hidden gems across the United States.</p>",imgs/selfie.jpg
